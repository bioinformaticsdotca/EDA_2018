You will be able to access them there for the foreseeable future.

1. Open RStudio.
2. Select **File â†’ NewProject...**
3. Click on **Version Control**.
4. Click on **Git**.
5. Enter https://github.com/hyginn/R-EDA as the Repository URL.
6. Type a `<tab>` character, the Project directory name field should then autofill to read `R-Intro`.
7. Click on **Browse...** to find your project directory. (You should have created a project directory. If you didn't, do it **now**). Click **Open**.
8. Click **Create Project**; the project files should be downloaded and the console should prompt you to type `init()` to begin.
